The project aims to develop a robot that mimics an insect-like behavior using input from two [flex sensors](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2290), acting as antennas of our insect and a [micro:bit](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2647?variant=32508815310897) at its core controlling the motors that drive our robot. Amidst all this is a [motor shield V3](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2337), acting as a bridge between the motor and the microcontroller. The flex sensor reads a different value when it is bent as opposed to its resting state, enabling us to detect if an obstacle has been hit, thereby acting as the sensory part of the setup. The motor shield on the other, provides power to drive the motors that the micro; bit alone cannot provide. Additionally, it is responsible for controlling the direction and speed of the motors.
