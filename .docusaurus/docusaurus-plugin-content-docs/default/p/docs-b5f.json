ArduBlock is a graphical programming language for Arduino that’s almost the same as Scratch. To follow this tutorial, you will need a computer and a CAROBOT SwissCHEESE education kit, including an Arduino Uno. This tutorial will be using the CarduBlock Edu branch of ArduBlock, a simplified version of the program that’s specialized for the SwissCHEESE.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/Introduction":{"id":"tutorials/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to the Carobot Tutorials","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/robot-with-real-time-temperature-display":{"id":"tutorials/robot-with-real-time-temperature-display","title":"Robot with Real-Time Temperature Display","description":"In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a robot that moves around and displays real-time temperature on a screen. By following the step-by-step instructions, you will learn how to assemble the necessary components, wire them together, and program the robot using Arduino IDE.
