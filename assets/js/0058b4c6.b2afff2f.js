Amidst all this is a motor shield V3, acting as a bridge between the motor and the microcontroller. The flex sensor reads a different value when it is bent as opposed to its resting state, enabling us to detect if an obstacle has been hit, thereby acting as the sensory part of the setup. The motor shield on the other, provides power to drive the motors that the micro; bit alone cannot provide. Additionally, it is responsible for controlling the direction and speed of the motors.","sidebar":"projectsSidebar"},"projects/Microbit-Robot/Working-Principle":{"id":"projects/Microbit-Robot/Working-Principle","title":"Working Principle","description":"The Microbit Insect Robot operates through a combination of microcontroller programming, electrical circuitry, and motor control. Central to its functionality is the micro:bit, which replaces the traditional Arduino microcontroller, interfacing with the Adafruit Motor Shield V2 to control the robot\'s movements and actions.","sidebar":"projectsSidebar"},"projects/moth-robot":{"id":"projects/moth-robot","title":"Moth Bot","description":"Objectives","sidebar":"projectsSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs."},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French."},"tutorials/CarduBlock-Edu-Tutorial":{"id":"tutorials/CarduBlock-Edu-Tutorial","title":"CarduBlock Edu Tutorial","description":"ArduBlock is a simple, fast, and fun way to program the CAROBOT SwissCHEESE. ArduBlock is a graphical programming language for Arduino that\u2019s almost the same as Scratch. To follow this tutorial, you will need a computer and a CAROBOT SwissCHEESE education kit, including an Arduino Uno. This tutorial will be using the CarduBlock Edu branch of ArduBlock, a simplified version of the program that\u2019s specialized for the SwissCHEESE.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/Introduction":{"id":"tutorials/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to the Carobot Tutorials","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/robot-with-real-time-temperature-display":{"id":"tutorials/robot-with-real-time-temperature-display","title":"Robot with Real-Time Temperature Display","description":"In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a robot that moves around and displays real-time temperature on a screen.
