# Our Mission

CAROBOT Learning and Research Organization is an Ontario Not-for-Profit Organization dedicated to hosting free workshop and running structured revenue courses at educational institutions and libraries. We use our funding and revenue to develop our own hardware and software teaching tools as well as providing STEM education at a reduced price compared to private company. We also share some of our lessons so you can learn STEM on your own even if you cannot attend our workshops or courses.

## How We Started

We started the CAROBOT Learning and Research Organization in 2016 because we noticed a lack of support for youth robotics in the Markham community. Thatâ€™s why we decided to start teaching courses to encourage youth and pass on knowledge about robotics. Along the way, we developed our own courses and intuitive robotics education tools. We want to continue expanding into other communities and spread the robotics revolution.

<!-- ### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. -->

<!-- ## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
